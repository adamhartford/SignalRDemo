# SignalRDemo
A basic self-hosted SignalR example. Created to demo [SwiftR](https://github.com/adamhartford/SwiftR "SwiftR").

## Note
I created this on a Mac using Xamarin Studio, running Mono 4.0.1. I'm not using SignalR Core from NuGet, but am instead referencing a custom built Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core.dll due to a Mono 4.0 bug.
